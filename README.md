2. Also download and install the Jupyter notebook from Anaconda software into the system if it is not already installed on the system.
3. Open the .ipynb files in Jupyter notebook and click on the run cells in the notebook.
4. Then you can see all the code chunks are being executed by showing the different outputs of visualized graphs. If you see any error once make sure to install all libraries that are used in this project and try again.
